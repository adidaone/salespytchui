                            SalesPytch three Founders - Laura McGregor, Ryan Mattock and Alistair Robinson - decided that it was time to move the commission based sales industry out of the dark ages and set out on a challenging mission to save company Principals and independent sales agents time, resources, stress and money by building simple, awesome software dedicated entirely the commission-only sales industry.

                            Previously, SalesPytch Founders had owned and run the UK branch of a large U.S. based digital Marketing company. Their first interaction with commission only sales agents began when they decided it was time to extend their company's reach in the Marketplace by partnering with self-employed sales agents. That's where the problems started: Where do you start looking for experienced self-employed sales agents, who were these people, did they exist and if so, what did they expect from a company before agreeing to work with them?

                            It took a few years of trial and error to start growing their team and they lost many wonderful sales agents along the way. It was simply too difficult to find great sales partners and became too time consuming to effectively manage their relationships with their independent sales team. Their sales reps also felt the strain of manually managing a remote working partnership and as a result of too much of their time being taken away from the ability to concentrate on selling, they began to leave. They knew there must be a better way.

The team knew that they had the resources and experience to set out to create something that would not only solve the problem for both companies and independent sales agents, but to go beyond that and create a revolutionary online service that would change the face of commission-only sales forever.</p>
